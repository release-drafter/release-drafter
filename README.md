## Usage

You can use the [Release Drafter GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/release-drafter) in a [GitHub Actions Workflow](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-github-actions) by configuring a YAML-based workflow file, e.g. `.github/workflows/release-drafter.yml`, with the following:

```yaml
name: Release Drafter

on:
  push:
    # branches to consider in the event; optional, defaults to all
    branches:
      - master
  # pull_request event is required only for autolabeler
  pull_request:
    # Only following types are handled by the action, but one can default to all as well
    types: [opened, reopened, synchronize]

jobs:
  update_release_draft:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # Drafts your next Release notes as Pull Requests are merged into "master"
      - uses: release-drafter/release-drafter@v5
        with:
          # (Optional) specify config name to use, relative to .github/. Default: release-drafter.yml
          # config-name: my-config.yml
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

If you're unable to use GitHub Actions, you can use the Release Drafter GitHub App. Please refer to the [Release Drafter GitHub App documentation](docs/github-app.md) for more information.

## Configuration

Once you‚Äôve added Release Drafter to your repository, it must be enabled by adding a `.github/release-drafter.yml` configuration file to each repository.

### Example

For example, take the following `.github/release-drafter.yml` file in a repository:

```yml
template: |
  ## What‚Äôs Changed

  $CHANGES
```

As pull requests are merged, a draft release is kept up-to-date listing the changes, ready to publish when you‚Äôre ready:

<img src="design/screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot of generated draft release" width="586" />

The following is a more complicated configuration, which categorises the changes into headings, and automatically suggests the next version number:

```yml
name-template: 'v$RESOLVED_VERSION üåà'
tag-template: 'v$RESOLVED_VERSION'
categories:
  - title: 'üöÄ Features'
    labels:
      - 'feature'
      - 'enhancement'
  - title: 'üêõ Bug Fixes'
    labels:
      - 'fix'
      - 'bugfix'
      - 'bug'
  - title: 'üß∞ Maintenance'
    label: 'chore'
change-template: '- $TITLE @$AUTHOR (#$NUMBER)'
change-title-escapes: '\<*_&' # You can add # and @ to disable mentions, and add ` to disable code blocks.
version-resolver:
  major:
    labels:
      - 'major'
  minor:
    labels:
      - 'minor'
  patch:
    labels:
      - 'patch'
  default: patch
template: |
  ## Changes

  $CHANGES
```

Release Drafter also supports [Probot Config](https://github.com/probot/probot-config), if you want to store your configuration files in a central repository. This allows you to share configurations between projects, and create a organization-wide configuration file by creating a repository named `.github` with the file `.github/release-drafter.yml`.

## Template Variables

You can use any of the following variables in your `template`:

| Variable        | Description                                                                                                           |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `$CHANGES`      | The markdown list of pull requests that have been merged.                                                             |
| `$CONTRIBUTORS` | A comma separated list of contributors to this release (pull request authors, commit authors, and commit committers). |
| `$PREVIOUS_TAG` | The previous releases‚Äôs tag.                                                                                          |

## Category Template Variables

You can use any of the following variables in `category-template`:

| Variable | Description                          |
| -------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `$TITLE` | The category title, e.g. `Features`. |

## Next Version Variables

You can use any of the following variables in your `template`, `name-template` and `tag-template`:

| Variable              | Description                                                                                                                                             |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `$NEXT_PATCH_VERSION` | The next patch version number. For example, if the last tag or release was `v1.2.3`, the value would be `v1.2.4`. This is the most commonly used value. |
| `$NEXT_MINOR_VERSION` | The next minor version number. For example, if the last tag or release was `v1.2.3`, the value would be `v1.3.0`.                                       |
| `$NEXT_MAJOR_VERSION` | The next major version number. For example, if the last tag or release was `v1.2.3`, the value would be `v2.0.0`.                                       |
| `$RESOLVED_VERSION`   | The next resolved version number, based on GitHub labels. Refer to [Version Resolver](#version-resolver) to learn more about this.                      |

## Version Template Variables

You can use any of the following variables in `version-template` to format the `$NEXT_{PATCH,MINOR,MAJOR}_VERSION` variables:

| Variable | Description               |
| -------- | ------------------------- |
| `$PATCH` | The patch version number. |
| `$MINOR` | The minor version number. |
| `$MAJOR` | The major version number. |

## Version Resolver

With the `version-resolver` option version number incrementing can be resolved automatically based on labels of individual pull requests. Append the following to your `.github/release-drafter.yml` file:

```yml
version-resolver:
  major:
    labels:
      - 'major'
  minor:
    labels:
      - 'minor'
  patch:
    labels:
      - 'patch'
  default: patch
```

The above config controls the output of the `$RESOLVED_VERSION` variable.

If a pull requests is found with the label `major`/`minor`/`patch`, the corresponding version key will be incremented from a semantic version. The maximum out of major, minor and patch found in any of the pull requests will be used to increment the version number. If no pull requests are found with the assigned labels, the `default` will be assigned.

## Change Template Variables

You can use any of the following variables in `change-template`:

| Variable  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `$NUMBER` | The number of the pull request, e.g. `42`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `$TITLE`  | The title of the pull request, e.g. `Add alien technology`. Any characters excluding @ and # matching `change-title-escapes` will be prepended with a backslash so that they will appear verbatim instead of being interpreted as markdown format characters. @s and #s if present in `change-title-escapes` will be appended with an HTML comment so that they don't become mentions. |
| `$AUTHOR` | The pull request author‚Äôs username, e.g. `gracehopper`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `$BODY`   | The body of the pull request e.g. `Fixed spelling mistake`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `$URL`    | The URL of the pull request e.g. `https://github.com/octocat/repo/pull/42`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

## References

**Note**: This is only revelant for GitHub app users as `references` is ignored when running as GitHub action due to GitHub workflows more powerful [`on` conditions](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#on)

References takes an list and accepts strings and regex.
If none are specified, we default to the repository‚Äôs default branch usually master.

```yaml
references:
  - master
  - v.+
```

Currently matching against any `ref/heads/` and `ref/tags/` references behind the scene

## Categorize Pull Requests

With the `categories` option you can categorize pull requests in release notes using labels. For example, append the following to your `.github/release-drafter.yml` file:

```yml
categories:
  - title: 'üöÄ Features'
    label: 'feature'
  - title: 'üêõ Bug Fixes'
    labels:
      - 'fix'
      - 'bugfix'
      - 'bug'
```

Pull requests with the label "feature" or "fix" will now be grouped together:

<img src="design/screenshot-2.png" alt="Screenshot of generated draft release with categories" width="586" />

Adding such labels to your PRs can be automated by using [PR Labeler](https://github.com/TimonVS/pr-labeler-action) or [Probot Auto Labeler](https://github.com/probot/autolabeler).

## Exclude Pull Requests

With the `exclude-labels` option you can exclude pull requests from the release notes using labels. For example, append the following to your `.github/release-drafter.yml` file:

```yml
exclude-labels:
  - 'skip-changelog'
```

Pull requests with the label "skip-changelog" will now be excluded from the release draft.

## Include Pull Requests

With the `include-labels` option you can specify pull requests from the release notes using labels. Only pull requests that have the configured labels will be included in the pull request. For example, append the following to your `.github/release-drafter.yml` file:

```yml
include-labels:
  - 'app-foo'
```

Pull requests with the label "app-foo" will be the only pull requests included in the release draft.

## Replacers

You can search and replace content in the generated changelog body, using regular expressions, with the `replacers` option. Each replacer is applied in order.

```yml
replacers:
  - search: '/CVE-(\d{4})-(\d+)/g'
    replace: 'https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-$1-$2'
  - search: 'myname'
    replace: 'My Name'
```

## Autolabeler

You can add automatically a label into a pull request, with the `autolabeler` option. Available matchers are `files` (glob), `branch` (regex), `title` (regex) and `body` (regex).

```yml
autolabeler:
  - label: 'chore'
    files:
      - '*.md'
    branch:
      - '/docs{0,1}\/.+/'
  - label: 'bug'
    branch:
      - '/fix\/.+/'
    title:
      - '/fix/i'
  - label: 'enhancement'
    branch:
      - '/feature\/.+/'
    body:
      - '/JIRA-[0-9]{1,4}/'
```

## Projects that don't use Semantic Versioning

If your project doesn't follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org) you can still use Release Drafter, but you may want to set the `version-template` option to customize how the `$NEXT_{PATCH,MINOR,MAJOR}_VERSION` environment variables are generated.

For example, if your project doesn't use patch version numbers, you can set `version-template` to `$MAJOR.$MINOR`. If the current release is version 1.0, then `$NEXT_MINOR_VERSION` will be `1.1`.

## Action Inputs

The Release Drafter GitHub Action accepts a number of optional inputs directly in your workflow configuration. These will typically override default behavior specified in your `release-drafter.yml` config.

| Input         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `config-name` | If your workflow requires multiple release-drafter configs it be helpful to override the config-name. The config should still be located inside `.github` as that's where we are looking for config files.                                                                                                                                                         |
| `name`        | The name that will be used in the GitHub release that's created or updated.

| `publish`     | A boolean indicating whether the release being created or updated should be immediately published. This may be useful if the output of a previous workflow step determines that a new version of your project has been (or will be) released, as with [`salsify/action-detect-and-tag-new-version`](https://github.com/salsify/action-detect-and-tag-new-version). |

## Action Outputs

The Release Drafter GitHub Action sets a couple of outputs which can be used as inputs to other Actions in the workflow ([example](https://github.com/actions/upload-release-asset#example-workflow---upload-a-release-asset)).

| Output       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| `tag_name`   | The name of the tag associated with this release.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `body`       | The body of the drafted release, useful if it needs to be included in files.                                                                                                                                                  |
| `html_url`   | The URL users can navigate to in order to view the release. i.e. `https://github.com/octocat/Hello-World/releases/v1.0.0`.                                                                                                    |
| `upload_url` | The URL for uploading assets to the release, which could be used by GitHub Actions for additional uses, for example the [`@actions/upload-release-asset GitHub Action`](https://www.github.com/actions/upload-release-asset). |

## Developing

If you have Node v10+ installed locally, you can run the tests, and a local app, using the following commands:

```sh
# Install dependencies
yarn

# Run the tests
npm test

# Run the app locally
npm run dev
```

Once you've started the app, visit `localhost:3000` and you'll get [step-by-step instructions](https://probot.github.io/docs/development/#configuring-a-github-app) for installing it in your GitHub account so you can start pushing commits and testing it locally.

If you don‚Äôt have Node installed, you can use [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/):

```sh
# Run the tests
docker-compose run --rm app npm test
```

## Contributing

Third-party contributions are welcome! üôèüèº See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for step-by-step instructions.

If you need help or have a question, let me know via a GitHub issue.

## Deployment

If you want to deploy your own copy of Release Drafter, follow the [Probot Deployment Guide](https://probot.github.io/docs/deployment/).

## Releasing

Run the following command:

```bash
git checkout master && git pull && npm version [major | minor | patch]
```

The command does the following:

- Ensures you‚Äôre on master and don‚Äôt have local, un-commited changes
- Bumps the version number in [package.json](package.json) based on major, minor or patch
- Runs the `postversion` npm script in [package.json](package.json), which:
  - Pushes the tag to GitHub
  - Publishes the npm release
  - Deploys to [Now](https://now.sh)
  - Opens the GitHub releases page so you can publish the release notes
